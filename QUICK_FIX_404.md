# ✅ Fixed: Sample Images 404 Error

## What Was Wrong

The frontend was trying to load sample images from:
```
http://localhost:9010/api/v1/samples/pin1  ❌ (Frontend port)
```

But the API is on the backend:
```
http://localhost:9000/api/v1/samples/pin1  ✅ (Backend port)
```

---

## ✅ What I Fixed

Updated `SampleImageGallery.tsx` to prepend the correct `API_URL` to all sample image URLs.

**Before:**
```typescript
url: "/api/v1/samples/pin1"  // Relative URL, loaded from same origin (frontend)
```

**After:**
```typescript
url: `${API_URL}/api/v1/samples/pin1`  // Full URL pointing to backend
// http://localhost:9000/api/v1/samples/pin1
```

---

## 🧪 Verification

```bash
# Sample list API
curl http://localhost:9000/api/v1/samples | jq '.'
✅ Returns 3 samples

# Sample image download
curl http://localhost:9000/api/v1/samples/pin1 -o test.jpeg
✅ Downloads valid JPEG image (591x757px)
```

## 🎨 Now Working

1. **Open**: http://localhost:9010
2. **Scroll down** to "Try Sample Images"
3. **See 3 image thumbnails** loaded from backend
4. **Click any sample** to test upload + AI analysis

## ⚠️ Firebase Storage Issue (Separate)

You may see errors when actually uploading images:
```
404: The specified bucket does not exist.
Bucket: festpin.appspot.com
```

### To Fix Firebase Storage:

**Option 1: Enable in Firebase Console**
1. Go to https://console.firebase.google.com/
2. Select project: **festpin**
3. Go to **Storage** in left menu
4. Click "Get Started"
5. Choose **Production mode** (or test mode)
6. Select location (e.g., us-central)
7. Bucket will be created: `festpin.appspot.com`

**Option 2: Use Existing Bucket**
If you already have a bucket with a different name:
```bash
# Check your Firebase project buckets
# Update backend/.env
FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your-actual-bucket-name.appspot.com
```

**Option 3: Skip Storage for Now (Test with Samples Only)**
Sample images work without Firebase Storage!
- Sample images are served directly from `backend/sample_images/`
- No upload needed - just click to analyze
- Perfect for testing the vision AI

## 📝 Summary

**Problem**: Frontend couldn't load sample images (404 errors)  
**Root Cause**: URLs were relative, loaded from frontend instead of backend  
**Solution**: Updated URLs to use full backend API URL  
**Result**: ✅ Sample images now display correctly!

**Next**: Set up Firebase Storage to enable user image uploads (optional for sample testing)
